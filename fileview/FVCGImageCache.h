/** @brief On-disk cache of images.
  
 \warning Only 8-bit RGB or grayscale images are supported (with optional alpha).  Call FVBitmapContext::FVImageIsIncompatible to determine if an image needs to be redrawn.

 Conceptually, this class provides a dictionary of images.  It's presently implemented using a compressed file on disk for storage, but may do other clever things in future.  Two caches are provided: one for large images, and one for small images.  Use the class methods to store CGImages and to get an efficient key for those images; you cannot instantiate an FVCGImageCache and operate directly.
 
 Note that the "large" vs. "small" distinction is purely notional.  Clients are free to decide which they will use, as the underlying storage is identical in either case.

/** @brief Key for caching.
 
 Use this to get a key for caching images to disk, or anything else that requires a copyable key (e.g., NSDictionary).  If your object is represented by a file: URL, the key will attempt to be robust against file renaming.  Additionally, file: URL keys may use a more efficient hash/isEqual: implementation than NSURL itself, which is a very poor dictionary key.
