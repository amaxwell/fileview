/** Abstract class used for drawing in FileView
 
 FVIcon is a class cluster.  You should typically never receive an instance of FVIcon from its initializer, but will instead get an instance of a concrete subclass that correctly handles a given URL scheme or file type.

 The iconWithURL: factory method is designed to be cheap, in that it does no rendering, should will require very little memory or disk access just for initialization.  Only after calling renderOffscreen will memory usage increase substantially, as data is cached and bitmaps created.  Icons that won't be displayed for some time (scrolled out of sight) should be sent a releaseResources message by the view in order to free up (some) of the cached data.  Subsequent calls to renderOffscreen should be substantially less expensive, since data will be read from the disk cache.
 
 This class is thread safe, but it is not reentrant.  You can abuse it to create deadlocks.  Don't do that. */

 @return A URL that is appropriate for a missing file to be passed to iconWithURL:.  Don't rely on the scheme or path for anything. */

 Clients (i.e. FileView) calls this in order to see if renderOffscreen should be called.  If it returns YES, this method sets the desired size in the case of Finder icons, and the caller should then send renderOffscreen.  By the same token, if this returns NO, don't waste time on renderOffscreen.

 Draws the icon into an offscreen bitmap context.  Subclasses must override this.
 
 This is typically the most expensive call for an FVIcon subclass.  In general it should be called from a dedicated thread after needsRenderForSize: has been called, unless you're planning to draw synchronously.  This is required for correct drawing, since a placeholder will typically be drawn if the bitmap is not available. */

 Subclasses must override this.  The drawing has the following semantic requirements and guarantees at present:
 
 \li \c the image will be scaled proportionally and centered in the destination rect
 \li \c the view is responsible for using -[NSView centerScanRect:] as appropriate, but images may not end up on pixel boundaries
 \li \c any changes to the CGContextRef are wrapped by CGContextSaveGState/CGContextRestoreGState
 \li \c specific compositing operations should be set in the context before calling this method
 \li \c shadow will be respected (the clip path is only changed when rendering text)
 \li \c needsRenderForSize: and renderOffscreen must be called first, to check/set size
 \li \c a placeholder icon will be drawn if renderOffscreen has not been called or finished working
