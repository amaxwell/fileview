@class FVColorMenuMatrix;

/** @internal @brief Finder label menu view.
 
 FVColorMenuView provides an NSView subclass that is a close approximation of the Finder label color control.  Presently it's only available directly in code, but is easy to set up in code:
 @code
 NSMenuItem *anItem = [[NSMenuItem allocWithZone:[NSMenu menuZone]] initWithTitle:@"Finder Label" 
                                                                           action:@selector(changeFinderLabel:)
                                                                    keyEquivalent:@""];
 FVColorMenuView *menuView = [FVColorMenuView menuView];
 // target will be first responder
 [menuView setTarget:nil]; 
 [menuView setAction:@selector(changeFinderLabel:)];
 [anItem setView:menuView];
 // add anItem to a menu
 @endcode
 
 Although this class is marked for internal use only, it should be useful elsewhere.  It's dependent on the FVColorMenuView.nib, so make sure to copy that if you use this class.
